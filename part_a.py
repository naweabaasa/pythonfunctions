# 1.What is a function in Python?
# A function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task when you call it
# They help to avoid repetition of code
# A function is defined by a keyword "def"

# 2.Explain the difference between parameter and argument. 
# Parameter is a variable listed inside parentheses of a function while argument is a value that is sent to a function when it is called

# 3.What does the return keyword do? 
# The return key is used to send a value back to the caller

#4.	What is the output of this code? 
#def test(a, b=2):     
    #return a * b 
#print(test(3)) 
# a and b are parameters while 3 and 2 are an arguments; b parameter is being assigned value 2, return a*b means a is being multiplied by b
# So print(test(3)) means 3 is assigned to a thus a multiplied by 3
# thus the output of the function will be 6
